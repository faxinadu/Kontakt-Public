# Creator Tools NCKC Widgets

The control files (.nckc) are files that are created by exporting a single control or a panel container of controls. These files can then be imported in a later GUI Designer project, shared with collaborators or set the foundation for building custom UI libraries. 

Included here are a number of NCKC files, useful as examples or for quick prototyping.

To import an NCKC file simply chose the import option from the widget selection menu in the Creator Tools GUI Designer. 

If the NCKC files are pointing to graphical assets such as png animation strips for sliders, fonts, and backgrounds as is the case with the files included here place the included assets in the /Resources/Pictures of your project. It is also easy to reuse the structure of a NCKC file with different assets (without needing to rearrange everything), by just replacing the asset with a different one of the same size.
